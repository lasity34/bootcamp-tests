## Overview 📝

In this section, I focused on learning Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Mocha. I configured Mocha to run unit tests in the browser, learned how to structure tests, and got hands-on experience with assertions using ChaiJS.

## Definition of Done ✅

By the end of this section, I gained proficiency in:

- Configuring Mocha to run unit tests in the browser
- Running Mocha tests in the browser
- Structuring a unit test using Mocha
- Using `assert` statements to validate function output
- Fixing failing unit tests
- Using ChaiJS for advanced assertions

---

## Skills Acquired 🌟

- **Mocha Configuration**: Learned how to set up Mocha to run tests in a browser environment.
- **Running Tests**: Gained hands-on experience in running unit tests through the browser.
- **Test Structuring**: Understood the structure and syntax for writing unit tests in Mocha.
- **Assertions**: Used assertions to check if a function returns the expected result, both using native `assert` and ChaiJS for more advanced checks.

## Functions Tested 🛠️

I wrote unit tests for the following functions, adhering to TDD principles:

- `greet`
- `isFromBellville`
- `regCheck`
- `countRegNumber`
- `isWeekday`
- `yearsAgo`
- `countAllPaarl`
- `countAllFromTown`
- `transportFee`
- `totalPhoneBill`
- `fromWhere`
- `findItemsOver20`
- `findItemsOver`
- `mostProfitableDepartment`

Each function also has a corresponding implementation, and all unit tests are passing successfully.
